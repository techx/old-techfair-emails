The first offense means you will not be able to take any new\ncompanies that reach out to us. The second offense will result in giving\naway a company. I\'m generally happy with the job everyone\'s done so far,\nand I had a great time with you guys during the retreat - I hope you\nunderstand that these potential penalties aren\'t a result of me being\nangry, but rather out of a need to make sure everyone keeps pace.\nFor special exceptions/incredibly busy weeks, *reach out to me individually\nBEFORE you miss deadlines.*  I will generally be understanding.\nRichard')GBM proxy in the group\'s ASA Database entry\nmay exercise the group\'s vote.

Constitutions required\nAll groups have long been required to have a constitution, but the ASA\nhas only recently begun checking that constitution URLs actually point\nat an extant constitution. We realize that in many cases groups may no\nlonger have a copy of their constitution, and may therefore need to\nwrite a new constitution. All groups should ensure that the ASA\nDatabase (https://asa.mit.edu/) contains a current, accurate\nconstitution URL by early IAP. If necessary, groups should write,\ndiscuss, and approve a new constitution by then (see\nhttp://web.mit.edu/asa/start/constitution-req.html for requirements).\nIf for some reason that is not feasible, please let us know --- we\'d\nrather have a constitution that works well for your group, than a bad\none hastily approved.\nAdditionally, we think group members should be able to easily find and\nview their group\'s constitution. At the moment, constitution URLs are\nconsidered \"private\" in the database and available only to the listed\nPresident, Treasurer, or Group Admin. We\'re currently planning on\nmaking constitution URLs visible to the MIT community, so that group\nmembers can easily find their constitution. If you or your group has\nconcerns about this change, please let us know (asa-exec@mit.edu).\n-------------------------------------------------------\n4. Recruitment moratorium feedback\nAs with previous years, the ASA this year had recruitment rules that,\nin short, forbade ASA-recognized groups from recruiting during the\nthree weeks leading up to the ASA Midway. (The full recruitment rules,\nalong with some potential updates for next year, are at\nhttp://web.mit.edu/asa/rules/recruitment-rules.html.) As with the last\nseveral years, this year we revised the rules to try to make them\nclearer and easier to both understand and enforce. We would like to\nget feedback from groups about these rules while moratorium is still\n(relatively) fresh in your minds. Please fill out the survey at\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHA2N3l6TzRzQWdoQUVsc2dGNDViOEE6MQ,\nor email us your views.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nPlease feel free to email asa-exec@mit.edu with any requests,\nquestions, or other inquiries.\nSincerely,\nThe ASA Executive Board\nhttp://web.mit.edu/asa/about/board-members.html\n_______________________________________________\nasa-official mailing list\nasa-official@mit.edu\nhttp://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/asa-official')
